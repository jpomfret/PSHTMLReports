# PSHTMLReports

Demos for my Beautiful PSHMTL Report session

## Abstract

Have you ever created an automated process where you need to deliver some kind of information afterwards? Perhaps by email, or creating a status page? If you answered yes, then this talk is for you!

There is a great community module called PSHTML that creates a domain-specific language (DSL) for generating HTML straight from your PowerShell code. I’ve used this module for years to deliver beautiful emails and it seems to me that not enough people know this module even exists, let alone how to use it. I plan on changing that at PSConfEU this year!

In my day job as a database administrator, there are many ‘morning tasks’ I like to complete to ensure that things are behaving as expected. Are all my SQL Servers healthy? Is there plenty of room left on our file shares? Has a certain process been executed successfully?

Since we’re at PSConfEU, we all know that these tasks can be completed with PowerShell – but the missing piece is delivering the outcome of the script in an easy-to-digest format. This is where the PSHTML module steps in – we can create headings, paragraphs, and lists to display this information. You can even take a PowerShell object and with just one line of code create a HTML table.

This session will be packed with demos, and all the code will be available for you to take back to your day jobs and impress your leaders.
